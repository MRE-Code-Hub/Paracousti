Paracousti is an underwater sound propagation tool used to investigate changes to the marine environment from arrays of current- and wave-energy converters. Paracousti solves the governing equations with a finite-difference, time-domain scheme that can be massively parallelized for use on high performance computing clusters. Development and application of the Paracousti code is led by Sandia National Laboratories' [Water Power Technologies Department](https://energy.sandia.gov/energy/renewable-energy/water-power/market-acceleration-deployment/) and [Montana State University](http://www.montana.edu/ejohnson/index.html).
