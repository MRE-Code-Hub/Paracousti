# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
# Happy Jekylling!
# Build and theme for building local version
#gem "jekyll", "~> 3.8.3"
#gem "minimal-mistakes-jekyll"
# The remote version since this is not a default Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages. Also change in _config.yml
# don't forget to rebuild
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
#remote_theme: "mmistakes/minimal-mistakes"

# If you want to use GitHub Pages, remove the "gem "jekyll"" above and
# uncomment the line below. To upgrade, run `bundle update github-pages`.
# gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins

# If you have any plugins, put them here!
