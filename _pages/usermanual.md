## Overview
Paracousti is an underwater sound propagation tool used to investigate changes to the marine environment from arrays of current- and wave-energy converters. Paracousti solves the governing equations with a finite-difference, time-domain scheme that can be massively parallelized for use on high performance computing clusters.

The creation and analysis of a Paracousti model can be performed with most any computer language. The documentation here currently details routines that can be run in MATLAB, but will be expanded in the future to include using Python. The Paracousti [user manual]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Paracousti_UserManual.pdf) provides additional details on how to setup a model with a pre-processor and details on how the data is stored to be investigated in post-processing. [Tutorials and example files]({{site.baseurl}}/tut) are available and will be continuously added to.
